# Neural network from scratch

Neural network with gradient-decent backpropagation from scratch using only NumPy to make matrix computation easier and faster. Network in question classifies datapoints based on X, Y coordinates to one of three classes, data from nnfs' dataset "spiral data". 

Network reaces accuracy of 0.977 and cross entropy loss 0.083 after 1e6 iterations using gradient decent with fixed stepsize 0.03.

Based on lecture's by Vizuara.
